# Request body snippets

This folder contains the JSON request bodies for API requests that are written out in the Azure Digital Twins documentation. For the request URLs and other required information to send a complete request, please visit the accompanying documents and view the code snippets in context.

## Contents

Below is a list of the request bodies that are contained in this folder, including mappings between the samples and the documents in which they appear, and descriptions of each.

| JSON request body file | Used in | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filter.json | [how-to-manage-routes-apis-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-manage-routes-apis-cli) | Body of a request that adds a filter to an event route |

## Strategy

Since these are separate requests, each one is kept separately as its own file. Documents can then reference these files by name to pull in the entire snippet.

# Sample code snippets

This folder contains the source code for specific samples that are included in the Azure Digital Twins documentation. These are larger, self-contained snippets that combine several SDK calls to accomplish a specific purpose, according to a tutorial or how-to.

## Contents

Below is a list of the samples that are contained in this folder, including mappings between the samples and the documents in which they appear, and descriptions of each.

| updateTSI.cs | [how-to-integrate-time-series-insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-integrate-time-series-insights) | The body of an [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)-triggered [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) that converts twin update events from their original JSON Patch form to JSON objects that can be consumed by [Azure Time Series Insights (TSI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/time-series-insights/overview-what-is-tsi) |

## Strategy

Since these are separate samples, each one is kept separately as its own file. Documents can then reference these files by name to pull in the entire sample.

There are also places where one of the larger sample files contains [named tags](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/code-in-docs?branch=master#named-snippet) to identify smaller sections, which are called out in the docs and displayed separately.
